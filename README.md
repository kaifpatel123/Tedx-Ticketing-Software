# Tedx-Ticketing-Software
This script automates TEDx KREA 2025 ticketing: it reads attendee data from CSV, generates unique ticket numbers, selects templates, overlays ticket IDs on images, and emails tickets with a rules PDF. It logs all issued tickets, supports speaker/tier/type codes, and ensures reliable delivery with Gmail SMTP.
